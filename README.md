How to access a terminal in VS
    Community: Ctrl + ` or View -> Terminal
    VSCode: Ctrl + Shift + ` or Terminal -> New Terminal

1) Install Visual Studio (I suggest VSCode, as it's lighter to run.  If you dont already have one installed)
2) Install npm: https://nodejs.org/en/download/  (If not installed already)
    Can check if npm is installed in a terminal with "npm -v"
3) Install Yarn via npm:  (If not already installed)
    Can check if yarn is installed in a terminal with "yarn check"
    In visual studio open a terminal 
    "npm install --global yarn"

4) Fill out constants.js file with your info. (Ask me for help if needed)
5) To start bot just type yarn start in the terminal
